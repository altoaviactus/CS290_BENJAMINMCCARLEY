        <div class="overflow-example">Muffin. I always called her the "little love of my life". She was happiness embodied
            A senior cat that could do no harm, and was only capable of love and affection. The only thing that was better
            than laying on my lap was rolling around in the sunshine. Wherever she is now, I hope it is as warm as she wants,
            with as much sunshine as she deserves.

    <div class="float-example">Muffin first came to us in 2013. Dropped onto our neighbors roof by a large bird.
        We assumed she was on the younger side, but it turned out she was just malnourished and was around 7 years
        old. An odd cat, she couldn't meow, only made odd squeaking sounds. Her eyes looked in different directions
        and she never got over 7 pounds. Many vets said it was the tiniest cat they'd seen (size wise at least, she
        was pretty fat when she was younger).

        <div class="clearfix">One thing I will always be happy about, is when I first started dating my girlfriend about 7 
            months ago, my birthday was coming up soon so she decided to paint my favorite thing in the world, muffin. In my 
            eyes this is the most beautiful painting ever made, and I am so proud to have it.
