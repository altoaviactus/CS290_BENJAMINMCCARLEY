Oooh its so hard to decide what I want! I would love to have something nice looking by the end of the term that incorporates my pixel art, as with an injured arm its the only art I can do right now. Maybe something
cozy, but I have been leaning into making some supernatural sightings website. Will add more details as they come to me, assignment 1 was just a proof of concept an figuring html out!
