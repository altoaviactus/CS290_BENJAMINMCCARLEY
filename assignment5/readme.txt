Hey! this code just takes a cat name, and saves it to a text file. It has two buttons as requested, and mostly works!
For some reason the background just did not work for me (was having bizarre layering issues), so I just opted to remove it.
I know I moved away from the theme two weeks ago, but this one is really cat themed! I included some cute pictures.
Do not tell my mom that she is in the first picture, but that pic is too dang cute to not use. Thats muffin in her
sweater, my old baby that passed. The pic is from a few months ago, but I am so happy I took it.
